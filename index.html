<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
    Hello! My name is Morgan Ambourn. I am currently a junior at Iowa State University getting my bachelor of science in computer engineering. My expected graduation is May 2021. 
</p>
<p>
Last summer I worked at Optum as a software engineering intern. I had the opportunity to work in a team on an Angular web application. The summer prior to that I did a research internship in Wales within the magnetic department of Cardiff University. At the university I worked under a professor to help redesign and reprogram a permeameter system.
</p>

<p>
During the school year, I work part time for Krell Institute's IT department. I am lead of the networking team and am also a member of the web administration team.

<h1> Project Descriptions </h1>
<p>
    This past summer I worked on a project through a research internship. I was working under a professor in the magnetics department of Cardiff University. The goal of the project was to reprogram one of the machines, called a DC permeameter, that the professor used for testing the magnetic properties of metal samples. First, I had to learn about how the system worked, which included the basics of magnetization. I went through the existing code of the machine and ran metal samples through the machine to understand how it originally worked so that I could determine what to improve and make more efficient. The last part of the project was setting up a new system with all new hardware and the new code that I wrote for it. Through this experience I gained the skill of LabVIEW programming and I gained knowledge in magnetics and the experimental process. This project is important because the machine I reprogrammed can be used to determine magnetic characteristics of metal, which the professor then shares with people in industry, outside of academia. The information gained from the tests can help companies determine the best materials to use for different electronic products.

    Another project I have worked on was creating an LED game board. Our project used an Arduino to program a grid of LEDs into different interactive games. We created a tic tac toe game in which two different players could play each other using a DS4 controller. My contribution to the project was thinking through the logic of the game and implementing the code. Getting the controller to connect to the Arduino was also a challenge I faced on the project. I completed this project in a group of four students through the course CPRE186, so part of what was learned through the project was how to work successfully in a team and meet deadlines. I also learned about how hardware and software connect. I got experience with programming in the Arduino’s coding language and experience soldering LEDs and wires together. This project is applicable outside of the classroom in a few different ways. It taught us how to use available libraries already developed for Arduino, which is important because as engineers we are not expected to reinvent the wheel, but rather make use of available resources. It was also a good introduction to the idea of embedded systems, combining hardware and software.

<h1> Ethics Essay </h1>
<p>
    The purpose of a Code of Ethics is to have a baseline for behavior within a community. It defines expectations to ensure the safety, comfort and inclusion of all members within and outside of that community. It also shows potential new members of the community what morals the organization aligns with so that new members can make an educated decision as to whether they want to be apart of that organization. \
</p>
    When I am faced with an ethical situation, I think about how my decision would affect others and myself. I try to make decisions that would optimize the outcome for the most people involved. Some decisions can be tricky if they don’t have an equal impact on the people they affect. If bettering my own situation comes at the cost of hurting other people, I do my best to make the decision that causes the least amount of negative impact on others. If I had to decide between something that significantly improves my situation but is harmful to others or something that is neutral to me but not harmful to others, I would have to choose the latter. I believe it is important to be honest in all behavior because even though unethical behavior may go unnoticed by others, I try to act in a way I’d hope others would. Without that mutual trust within society, it is hard for anyone to succeed in life.

    My group discussed the ethics of working for a defense company. I had not thought of the ethical implications of advancing technology that could ultimately be used to kill people even though it is designed to ensure the safety of the country. In a lot of defense companies, there is such high security that an employee may have no awareness of what their individual contribution is going towards.  I personally would not work for such a company, and I found that other members of my group agreed. While some were hesitant about the development of weaponry and defense technology, it was also understood that this advancement is what keeps our country safe. Ultimately, my group decided that the decision to work for a defense company comes down to an individuals morals and beliefs about war and security.
<p>
    The case that my group discussed was about Volkswagen’s cars falsely passing emissions testing. Volkswagen was asked to recall 482,000 (which later was thought to be as many as 11 million) cars because the cars were up to 40 times more pollutant than is allowed by regulations of the Environment Protection Agency. The ICCT discovered that VW broke the Clean Air Act and could receive a fine of $37,500 per vehicle. As much as 900,00 tons of NOx in excess was emitted yearly due to these cars. 
</p> 
    A question in this ethical dilemma is whether the deceitful software was due to a few lower level workers, some lacking management, or whether it was a wider company culture of profit over safety. It is still undecided within the case whether the higher-level management was aware of this unethical software, but if the management was unaware, this could be indication of management not keeping as close of an eye on projects as they should. If management was aware of the deceitful software, they were putting their profit above the health of the environment and the community. The IEEE Code of Ethics states in the first item that members need to “accept responsibility in making decisions” which was not followed by VW employees in this case. No one stepped forward to take responsibility for the decision to allow or create deceitful software. The code of ethics also states that members should be cognoscente of the “safety, health, and welfare of the public”. Enabling excess emissions can cause respiratory problems and even cancer, which demonstrates a neglect for the safety of the public. 
<p>
    The three virtue ethics that relate most to VW’s case study are integrity, honesty, and responsibility. Integrity is “moral uprightness” which was not upheld by either the engineers or the management within VW. Creating a system that gets around regulations to increase profit at the cost of the environment is not of high ethical standing. Honesty is truthfulness and openness, not something that VW exercised. The emission test passing software deceived the Environment Protection Agency by suggesting that VW’s vehicles were emitting at an acceptable level, which was in fact a lie. Responsibility is the accountability and recognition of the obligation to act for the good of others. The only good that VW was acting for was the good of the company. Profits may have been bettered but the health of the community was compromised. 
</p>
    Within this case study, the company has an ethical obligation to follow regulations, but also to be aware of how they are affecting air quality and the health of people on a global scale. This obligation requires that engineers think about how their technology is impacting the community and requires that engineers design systems that are environmentally friendly and safe for use. This obligation applies to other professional activities besides this car company with emissions regulations. Being aware of the health and safety of people is relevant to literally any job anywhere. Doctors need to make decisions that will improve patient health instead of just getting profit from an expensive procedure. Architects cannot cut corners in design or materials used to ensure the safety of structures built. Transportation workers (bus drivers, pilots, train engineers) need to prioritize passenger safety over speed of trip to ensure passenger safety.  
<p>
    The best course of action to right the wrong that VW has done is for VW to take full responsibility for their mistake. Management needs to be more aware of what their engineers are implementing, and engineers need to be making technology that aligns with the company’s code of ethics. Significant emissions have been released so it would also make sense for VW to put in an effort to make up for the high emissions by decreasing their current emissions even more than the regulation dictates.
